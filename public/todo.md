## The game should be played with a standard deck of playing cards (52).
## The house should be dealt two cards, hidden from the player until the house reveals its hand.
## The player should be dealt a hand that contains two cards, visible to the player.
## The player should have a chance to hit (i.e. be dealt another card) until they decide to stop or they bust (i.e. their total is over 21 ).
## When the player stands, the house will reveal its hand and hit (i.e. draw cards) until they have 17 or more.
## If either the house or the player bust, they lose.
